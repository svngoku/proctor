# Proctor Package Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Proctor package to enhance its robustness, reliability, and developer experience.

## 1. Fixed Issues

1. Fixed malformed docstring in `FewShotCoT.generate_prompt()` method
2. Fixed import ordering and organization
3. Added proper error handling with custom exceptions

## 2. Performance Improvements

1. Implemented technique instance caching in `get_technique()` function
   - Prevents unnecessary object instantiation when the same technique is requested multiple times
   - Also applied to `list_techniques()` to reuse cached instances

2. Added retry mechanism for LLM API calls
   - Automatically retries transient errors (rate limits, service unavailability)
   - Uses exponential backoff for retry timing
   - Configurable maximum retry count

## 3. Reliability Improvements

1. Enhanced error handling
   - Added custom `LLMError` exception class
   - Added input validation for LLM calls
   - Added proper error propagation in PromptTechnique's execute method
   - Better error messages with clear indicators of what went wrong

2. Added comprehensive test suite
   - Unit tests for technique implementation
   - Tests for caching behavior
   - Tests for error handling
   - Mocked LLM API calls for deterministic testing

3. Improved package structure
   - Added setup.py with proper dependencies and metadata
   - Better organization of imports and exports
   - Clear categorization of techniques in __all__ declaration

## 4. Documentation Improvements

1. Added example for error handling
2. Improved docstrings with more detailed information
3. Added type hints for better IDE support
4. Added CLAUDE.md with coding guidelines

## 5. Future Improvement Suggestions

1. Implement async support for LLM calls
2. Add more comprehensive testing with higher coverage
3. Create proper API documentation with Sphinx
4. Add more examples for various use cases
5. Implement method to export/serialize prompts for sharing
6. Add performance benchmarking tools
7. Add result caching to avoid redundant LLM calls
