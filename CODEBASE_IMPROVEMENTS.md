# Proctor Codebase Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to the Proctor codebase to enhance its organization, clarity, and future-proofing.

### 1. Fixed Identifier Inconsistencies in Zero-Shot Techniques

We standardized the identifier system for the zero-shot techniques. Previously, all three techniques (EmotionPrompting, RolePrompting, and SelfAsk) shared the same identifier "2.2.2", which made categorization and filtering difficult.

Changes:
- `EmotionPrompting`: Changed identifier from "2.2.2" to "2.2.2.1"
- `RolePrompting`: Changed identifier from "2.2.2" to "2.2.2.2"
- `SelfAsk`: Changed identifier from "2.2.2" to "2.2.2.3"

This ensures that each technique has a unique identifier while maintaining their hierarchical relationship within the zero-shot category.

### 2. Enhanced Documentation

We improved the documentation across the codebase:

- Added detailed class-level docstrings for all techniques, explaining:
  - What the technique does
  - How it works
  - What effects it has on model outputs
  - When to use it

- Improved method-level docstrings with clearer parameter descriptions, return types, and usage examples

### 3. KNN Implementation Improvements

#### Current Implementation Clarity

We improved the transparency of the current KNN implementation:

- Added clear warnings that the current implementation uses random sampling rather than true KNN
- Added detailed comments explaining the simplification and its implications
- Enhanced docstrings with explicit warnings for production use

#### Advanced KNN Implementation (Future Use)

We created a foundation for a proper KNN implementation:

- Added a new module `proctor/few_shot/knn_implementation.py` with:
  - `SemanticKNN` class that uses text embeddings and cosine similarity
  - `EmbeddingCache` class for performance optimization
  - Comprehensive documentation and example usage
  - Graceful handling of missing dependencies

- Updated package configuration:
  - Added optional dependencies in pyproject.toml and setup.py
  - Created separate dependency groups: "knn", "dev", and "all"
  - Added example code demonstrating how to use the advanced implementation

### 4. Performance Improvements

We added several performance improvements:

- Embedding caching to avoid redundant computations
- Optimized implementation of KNN search
- Clear separation of concerns for better maintainability

### 5. Example Code

We created a new example (`examples/advanced_knn.py`) that demonstrates:

- The current KNN implementation (with random sampling)
- The advanced semantic KNN implementation
- How to compare their outputs
- How to properly install and use the optional dependencies

## Usage of New Features

### Installing Optional Dependencies

```bash
# For KNN functionality
uv pip install -e ".[knn]"

# For development
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# For all features
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Using Advanced KNN

```python
from proctor.few_shot.knn_implementation import SemanticKNN

# Initialize the KNN
knn = SemanticKNN()

# Create a pool of examples
examples_pool = [
    {"input": "What is machine learning?", "output": "A field of AI..."},
    {"input": "Explain quantum computing", "output": "Quantum computing..."},
]

# Find the most similar examples to a query
query = "How does deep learning work?"
similar_examples = knn.find_nearest(query, examples_pool)

# Use these examples in your prompt
for example, similarity in similar_examples:
    print(f"Similarity: {similarity:.2f}")
    print(f"Example: {example['input']}")
    print(f"Answer: {example['output']}")
```

## Future Improvements

The following improvements could be made in future updates:

1. Fully integrate the advanced KNN implementation into the main KNN class
2. Add support for more embedding models and customization options
3. Implement additional similarity metrics beyond cosine similarity
4. Add support for distributed computation for large example pools
5. Implement automated example generation using the embedding space
